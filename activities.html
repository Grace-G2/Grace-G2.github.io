<p1>Sleeping is definitely my favorite activity. I usually don't do anything other than sleep except my humans try to force
me to go on walks every once in a while. Don't worry, I do exercise for about five minutes everyday when I see my favorite human
pull in the driveway!</p1>

<h3>Laying in the Sun</h3>

<p2>I love to lay in the sun outside in the summer, and in the winter, I lay on the parts of the floor where the sun is shining inside.</p2>

<h4> Going for rides</h4>
