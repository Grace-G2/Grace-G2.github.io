<h3>The Best Day</h3>
<h4>August 20, 2015</h4>

<p> A few weeks prior to what I call "the best day", I was playing outside. I saw a lady running down the road, and I wanted
to go see who it was so I ran across the road without thinking about what I was doing. For some reason my owner, Cary, started freaking out.
All I was doing was crossing the road to go visit the running lady. The lady was super kind; she picked me up and petted me!
    Then, a big truck went by. I didn't see the big deal, but I heard Cary let out a big sigh of relief or something.</p>
    <p> Now I'll move onto the best day. Cary started packing up all of her belongings, and she put them into a big truck.
    She kept telling me that I was about to have a new family. I didn't really want a new family, but Cary told me that
they were really excited to have me. A silver car pulled in the yard just then, and it was the running lady! I ran over to
greet her, but she wasn't alone. She had a young boy with her who was soon to be my brother. They took me away from Cary, and
I was sad, but I was surprised that the house they brought me to was so nice! I had a huge yard to play in and a lot of toys.
This was where I met my favorite human ever, my dad! I met my sister there too, but she didn't really like me. This was the
        start of my new life, and I loved it! </p>
